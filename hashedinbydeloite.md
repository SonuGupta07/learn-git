# DHCP and DORA Process with Port Numbers

---

## What is DHCP?

**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters (like subnet mask, gateway, DNS servers) to devices on a network so they can communicate efficiently.

---

## DHCP Port Numbers

| Role          | Port Number | Description                         |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| **DHCP Client** | UDP Port 68  | Receives DHCP responses from server |
| **DHCP Server** | UDP Port 67  | Listens for DHCP requests from clients |

---

## DORA Process (DHCP Lease Acquisition)

The DORA process consists of **four steps** that a DHCP client follows to get an IP address from a DHCP server:

### 1. **D - DHCP Discover**
- The client broadcasts a **DHCP Discover** message to find available DHCP servers.
- Sent from **UDP port 68 (client)** to **UDP port 67 (server)**.
- Broadcast IP: `255.255.255.255`

### 2. **O - DHCP Offer**
- DHCP servers that receive the Discover message respond with a **DHCP Offer** message.
- Offers an IP address and other network settings.
- Sent from **UDP port 67 (server)** to **UDP port 68 (client)**.
- Sent as broadcast or unicast depending on client state.

### 3. **R - DHCP Request**
- The client responds to the server by broadcasting a **DHCP Request** message, requesting the offered IP address.
- Sent from **UDP port 68 (client)** to **UDP port 67 (server)**.
- Broadcast message so all DHCP servers know which offer was accepted.

### 4. **A - DHCP Acknowledgment**
- The DHCP server sends a **DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK)** to confirm the IP address assignment.
- Sent from **UDP port 67 (server)** to **UDP port 68 (client)**.
- Client can now use the IP address.

## Summary Table of DORA Messages and Ports

| Step         | Message Type       | Source Port | Destination Port | Description                    |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Discover     | DHCP Discover      | 68          | 67               | Client searches for DHCP server|
| Offer        | DHCP Offer         | 67          | 68               | Server offers IP address       |
| Request      | DHCP Request       | 68          | 67               | Client requests offered IP     |
| Acknowledgment| DHCP ACK          | 67          | 68               | Server confirms IP assignment  |

---

## Additional Notes

- DHCP uses **UDP** as its transport protocol because it is lightweight and suitable for broadcast messages.
- Communication often uses broadcast IP because the client may not have an IP address before the process completes.
- DHCP can also provide other settings like DNS servers, subnet mask, lease time, and default gateway.

---

Feel free to ask if you want a diagram or more details on any step!

- it works on application layer but dependent for sending the message using udp protocol is depend on transport layer
- here cliet server model works means client works as client server works as server not peer to peer model means here sometime client works as server and sometimes server works as client
# What is DHCP Scope?

A **DHCP Scope** is a range or pool of IP addresses  
that a DHCP server can assign to clients on a particular subnet or network segment.

---

## Key Points about DHCP Scope:

- It defines the **starting and ending IP address** limits  
  from which the server leases IP addresses dynamically.

- It may include additional network configuration parameters  
  like subnet mask, default gateway, DNS servers, lease duration, etc.

- Each **scope is associated with a specific subnet**,  
  so DHCP knows which IP addresses to assign based on the client's network location.

- You can configure **multiple scopes** on a DHCP server  
  to serve different subnets or VLANs.

- The DHCP server only assigns addresses **within the defined scope**.

---

## Example:

If the DHCP scope is set as:  
**192.168.1.100** to **192.168.1.200**

- The server will lease IPs only within this range to clients.  
- Addresses outside this range won't be assigned by this DHCP scope.

---

## Summary:

> **DHCP Scope** = A set range of IP addresses and related parameters  
> that the DHCP server manages and assigns to clients in a specific network.

# OSI Model – Explained in Detail

The **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)** is a **conceptual framework** that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into **seven distinct layers**. Each layer has a specific function and communicates with the layers directly above and below it.

The OSI model was developed by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** and is used to understand and design networks and communication systems.

Let me know if you'd like a diagram or visual chart to go with this!
- we not practically implement the osi model the practically implement model is tcp/ip model 
- sometime we get confiused which layer is the top layer of osi model it depend the role on which you are if you are on sender side the first layer is application layer if you are on reciever side the first layer is physical layer
##  short cut to remember the layers 
## All People Seems To Need Data Processing
- application ,presentation , session layer act as software layer
- network layer, data link layer, physical layer act as a hardware layer
- Transport layer act with both software and hard ware
## In TCP/IP MODEL
- it apply practically in the world
- application presentation and sessoin layers makes the application layer 
- transport , network , datalink, physical makes as same as same in tcp/ip model 
- in some book the application, presentation , session layer makes the application layer while transport layer is becomes host to host  and network layer becomes Internet layer, and data link layer and physical layer makes up network access layer
- it is different name  in different books but the working is same in both the as osi layers 
- data -> segment -> packet-> frame -> Bit at last and get transport in the network 
# 📡 TCP/IP Model – Complete Explanation

The **TCP/IP model** (also called the **Internet Protocol Suite**) is a **real-world, practical networking model**  
used to describe how data is transmitted over the internet. It is the foundation of the **modern internet**  
and is simpler than the OSI model, consisting of **4 layers**.

## mac address or physical address or burnt in address (bia)
## mac address is global unique
# 🆚 Difference Between Logical Address and Physical Address

In computer networks and operating systems, **logical addresses** and **physical addresses**  
refer to different ways of identifying locations in memory or on a network.

---

## 📌 Logical Address (IP Address)

| Feature             | Description                                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | An address assigned by software to identify a device |
| **Example**          | `192.168.1.5` (IP Address)                            |
| **Used by**          | Network Layer (OSI Layer 3)                          |
| **Purpose**          | To uniquely identify a device on a network           |
| **Changeable?**      | Yes, can be changed dynamically (e.g., DHCP)         |
| **Scope**            | Logical (used by routers for routing decisions)      |
| **Visibility**       | Seen in software, applications, and network configs  |

---

## 📌 Physical Address (MAC Address)

| Feature             | Description                                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | A hardware address burned into a network card        |
| **Example**          | `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E` (MAC Address)                     |
| **Used by**          | Data Link Layer (OSI Layer 2)                        |
| **Purpose**          | To uniquely identify a device within a local network |
| **Changeable?**      | No (typically permanent; set by hardware vendor)     |
| **Scope**            | Local (used within the same LAN)                     |
| **Visibility**       | Detected by switches and NICs; not usually seen by users |

---

## 🔁 Relationship Between the Two

- **Logical addresses** are used by routers to forward packets between networks.
- **Physical addresses** are used by switches to deliver frames inside the same network.
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** is used to convert a logical address (IP) into a physical address (MAC).

---

## 🧠 Real World Analogy

| Address Type     | Analogy                                |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Logical Address  | Your home’s mailing address             |
| Physical Address | The GPS coordinates of your house       |

---

## ✅ Final Summary

> **Logical Address = IP Address (used for global identification & routing)**  
>  
> **Physical Address = MAC Address (used for local delivery on the same network)**

Both are essential for data communication: one for **routing across networks**,  
and the other for **delivery within the same local network**.

---
# ❓ Why Do Routers Use IP Addresses Instead of MAC Addresses?

Routers are designed to connect **different networks** and move data **across the internet**.  
To do this efficiently, they rely on **IP addresses**, not MAC addresses.

Here’s why:

---

## 🔸 1. MAC Addresses Are Only Valid Within a Local Network (LAN)

- A **MAC address** is a unique hardware address assigned to a network card.
- It is used for communication **within a local network**, like between two devices connected to the same switch.
- Routers operate **between networks**, so they don’t carry or store MAC addresses beyond the local segment.

> Routers don’t care about where a MAC address came from — they only care about where to **send the packet next** using IP.

---

## 🔸 2. IP Addresses Are Globally Routable

- **IP addresses** are structured to include **network information**, making it possible to route data **across the internet**.
- Example: `192.168.1.5` is part of a private network; `8.8.8.8` belongs to Google’s DNS servers.
- Routers use this structure to **forward packets to the right destination**.

> MAC addresses have **no location information**, while IP addresses are like a map with directions.

---

## 🔸 3. Routers Use Routing Tables Based on IP Addresses

- Routers maintain **routing tables** that help decide where to forward a packet.
- These tables are built using **IP address ranges**, not MAC addresses.
- IP is hierarchical (organized by regions, ISPs, etc.); MAC is flat (just a unique ID).

---

## 🔸 4. MAC Addresses Don’t Work Across Multiple Networks

- When a packet moves from one network to another, the MAC address changes at each hop.
- The **IP address remains the same** throughout the journey.
- So only IP can **guide the packet across multiple routers** to its final destination.

---

## 🔸 5. Efficiency and Scalability

- IP allows routers to handle billions of devices by grouping them into subnets.
- MAC addresses would require routers to track every single device globally, which is not scalable.

---

## ✅ Final Summary

> Routers use **IP addresses** because they are **designed for global communication** and  
> **contain network information** needed for **routing across multiple networks**.

> In contrast, **MAC addresses are only used within local networks** and change as packets  
> move from one network segment to another.

---

## 📌 Analogy

| Type         | Analogy                                 |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| MAC Address  | House number (works only within a street)|
| IP Address   | Full postal address (needed by the postal system to deliver across cities) |

---
- mac address device me network interface card ka hota hai jo change kar sakta hai network interface card badlne par means ek device me jitne network interface hoga utna mac address hoga eg wifi,bluetooth,hdmi port
- macadrees of 48 bits->6byte 48 = 24 bits(oui) +24 bits(vendor specific)
- mac address is represent in hexadecimal 
## Dns 
- dns does both if you give domain it give the ip if you give ip it gives the domain mostly attacked is done on dns 
- it operates on application layer 
- it uses udp and tcp both max udp port number at port 53
- there are two way to resolve the hostname to ip address the first is by building the host table on each router and the second is to build a dns server first is not good if the internet has million of host 
- domain of theree type 
- 1.generic eg .net, .edu ,.org , .mil
- 2.country eg .us , .uk , .in 
- 3.inversion ip to domain name mapping 
- there is a two method to resolve the domain name first one is iterative and second one is recursive method 
## iterative method to get the ip of domain eg www.ccna.tg.in 
- first it see it cache or ask from the local internet provider(name server) if it has the ip address then it gives the ip address directly else it isp request it to the root name server it see the url and tell he not know the exact the address of the domain but the it know the ip address of .in domain it send the ip address to the name server  name server again request to the ip address he says he not know the exact ip address of the domain but he know the ip address of that server .tcg domain realted again it send the ip to the name server after that the domain may get resolve or it can give other ip address which know the address of that domain 
# In recursive mehthod the ip is not comes to the name server all the time name server -> root name server -> name server -> name server it it get the ip of the domain recurrsively it comes to the local name server 
# 🌐 What is a TLD Server?

**TLD (Top-Level Domain) Server** is a crucial part of the DNS (Domain Name System) hierarchy.  
It handles the **top-level part** of domain names, such as `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.in`, `.edu`, etc.

---

## 🏷️ Example

When resolving the domain name:

# 🌐 DNS (Domain Name System) – Complete Working Explained

DNS (Domain Name System) is like the **Internet's phonebook**.  
It translates human-readable domain names (like `www.google.com`) into IP addresses (like `142.250.195.68`)  
so browsers can load websites.

---

## 🛠️ Basic Working of DNS

When you type a URL into your browser, DNS resolves the domain name through a hierarchy of servers:

1. **Root DNS Server**
2. **Top-Level Domain (TLD) Server**
3. **Authoritative DNS Server**

Each server performs a specific role in resolving the domain name.

---

## 🔗 Step-by-Step DNS Resolution Process

Let’s resolve: `www.example.com`

---

### 🔹 1. DNS Resolver (Client-Side)

- Your computer first checks its **local DNS cache**.
- If not found, it sends a query to a **recursive DNS resolver** (usually provided by your ISP or Google DNS `8.8.8.8`).

---

### 🔹 2. Root DNS Server

- The recursive resolver queries a **root server**.
- There are 13 sets of root servers globally (named `A` to `M`).
- The root server does **not know the final IP**, but it **knows where to find TLD servers**.

> Example Response:  
> "I don’t know where `www.example.com` is, but I know who handles `.com` domains."

- It returns the address of the **TLD DNS server** for `.com`.

---

### 🔹 3. Top-Level Domain (TLD) Server

- TLD servers manage the **last part** of domain names (like `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, etc.).
- The resolver now queries the **TLD server for `.com`**.

> Example Response:  
> "I don’t know `www.example.com`, but I know the authoritative server for `example.com`."

- It returns the address of the **authoritative DNS server**.

---

### 🔹 4. Authoritative DNS Server

- The authoritative server has **the final DNS record** for the domain.
- It provides the **exact IP address** for `www.example.com`.

> Example Response:  
> "`www.example.com` is at `93.184.216.34`"

---

### 🔹 5. DNS Resolver Returns IP to Client

- The recursive resolver gives this IP back to your browser.
- Your browser now makes an HTTP/HTTPS request to that IP and loads the website.

---

## 🗂️ Summary Table of DNS Server Roles

| Server Type            | Role                                                  |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Root DNS Server        | Directs to TLD server                                 |
| TLD Server             | Directs to authoritative DNS server for the domain    |
| Authoritative Server   | Provides final IP address of the requested domain     |
| DNS Resolver (Client)  | Coordinates and caches the entire lookup process      |

---

## 🔁 DNS Caching

- To reduce load and increase speed, each level result is **cached**:
  - Browser cache
  - OS cache
  - Recursive DNS cache

> Cached responses avoid repeating the full DNS query every time.

---

## 📌 Example Flow

1. User types `www.example.com`
2. Resolver → Root Server → TLD Server → Authoritative Server
3. Final IP returned: `93.184.216.34`
4. Browser connects to that IP to fetch the website

---

## ✅ Final Notes

- DNS makes the web human-friendly.
- It uses a **hierarchical** and **distributed** system for **speed**, **redundancy**, and **scalability**.
- Without DNS, users would need to remember numeric IPs instead of domain names.

A **Fully Qualified Domain Name** is the **complete and exact domain name** that specifies a device’s location in the DNS hierarchy.

### 🔸 Key Features:
- Includes **hostname**, **domain**, and **top-level domain**, ending with a **dot (.)**.
- **Unique** across the entire Internet.
- Resolves **without any additional information**.

### 🔹 Format:
- www.example.com.
- mail.google.com.

> The final dot (`.`) represents the **root DNS zone**. It’s usually implied and not typed.

---

## 🔶 Partially Qualified Domain Name (PQDN)

### 🔹 Definition:
A **Partially Qualified Domain Name** is an **incomplete domain name** that does **not include the full path** up to the DNS root.

### 🔸 Key Features:
- Often just the **hostname** or a **subdomain**.
- Requires **additional context** (like the local domain) to resolve.
- Commonly used **within private networks**.

### 🔹 Format:

### 🔹 Example:
- www
- mail.google
- intranet.local


> These names need to be completed (e.g., by a DNS suffix) by the operating system or DNS resolver.

## ✅ Summary

- **FQDN**: Fully detailed, routable name — works everywhere.
- **PQDN**: Shortened name — works only in local or configured DNS zones.

## ARP(address resolution protocol)
- by using logical address you get the physical adress at data link layer it is necessary to resolve the mac address of a devicea arp is a layer 2 protocol that is data link layer 
sender want the mac address then it sends broadcast but if destination send the mac address it unicast 
- arp is used in ipv4 environment 
- arp request is generated in same network 
## type of arp 

# 🔄 Types of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

ARP is used to map **IP addresses** to **MAC addresses** within a local network (LAN).  
There are several types of ARP, each serving a different purpose in network communication.

---

## 📋 1. Standard ARP (or just ARP)

- Used to **find the MAC address** corresponding to a known IP address.
- Works only within the **same local network**.
- Sends a **broadcast request** asking:  
  “Who has IP `192.168.1.5`? Tell me your MAC.”

---

## 📋 2. Reverse ARP (RARP)

- Opposite of ARP: used to find the **IP address** of a device when only the **MAC address** is known.
- Mostly obsolete; replaced by **DHCP**.
- Used by **diskless workstations** to get IP addresses from a server.

---

## 📋 3. Proxy ARP

- A router answers ARP requests **on behalf of another device**.
- Used when two devices are on **different networks** but appear as if they are on the same network.
- Helps in connecting different subnets without reconfiguring IP addresses.

---

## 📋 4. Gratuitous ARP

- A device sends an ARP **for its own IP address**.
- Used to:
  - **Update other devices' ARP caches**
  - **Detect IP conflicts**
  - Announce a new IP/MAC binding
- No reply is expected.

---

## 📋 5. Inverse ARP (InARP)

- Used to determine the **IP address** of a connected device when the **MAC address** is already known.
- Commonly used in **Frame Relay** and **ATM** networks.

---

## 📋 6. Static ARP

- Manually configured mapping of IP to MAC addresses.
- Never expires or needs ARP requests.
- Used in secure networks or to prevent spoofing.

| Type             | Purpose                                     | Usage Area           |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| ARP              | IP → MAC resolution                         | All IP networks       |
| RARP             | MAC → IP resolution                         | Legacy systems        |
| Proxy ARP        | Router answers ARP for another device       | Gateway routing       |
| Gratuitous ARP   | Announces own IP/MAC binding                | Conflict detection    |
| Inverse ARP      | MAC → IP (in WANs)                          | Frame Relay, ATM      |
| Static ARP       | Manual entry of IP-to-MAC mapping           | Secure setups         |

---

## ✅ Final Note

Most modern systems use:
- **Standard ARP** for basic communication
- **Gratuitous ARP** for updates/conflict checks
- **Proxy ARP** in specific routing configurations

# 📨 ARP Packet Format

The **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** packet is used to map an IP address to a MAC address within a local network.  
It is encapsulated inside an Ethernet frame when transmitted over a LAN.

---

## 📦 Structure of an ARP Packet (28 bytes)

| Field Name             | Size (bytes) | Description                                          |
|------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hardware Type**      | 2            | Type of hardware (Ethernet = `1`)                   |
| **Protocol Type**      | 2            | Type of protocol (IPv4 = `0x0800`)                   |
| **Hardware Size**      | 1            | Length of MAC address (Ethernet = `6`)              |
| **Protocol Size**      | 1            | Length of IP address (IPv4 = `4`)                   |
| **Opcode**             | 2            | Operation type: Request (`1`), Reply (`2`)          |
| **Sender MAC Address** | 6            | MAC address of the sender                           |
| **Sender IP Address**  | 4            | IP address of the sender                            |
| **Target MAC Address** | 6            | MAC address of the target (unknown in request)      |
| **Target IP Address**  | 4            | IP address of the target                            |

## 🧾 Example Breakdown: ARP Request

If Host A wants to know the MAC address of Host B with IP `192.168.1.2`, it sends:

- **Opcode**: 1 (Request)
- **Sender MAC**: MAC of Host A
- **Sender IP**: 192.168.1.1
- **Target MAC**: 00:00:00:00:00:00 (unknown)
- **Target IP**: 192.168.1.2

## 📤 Encapsulation in Ethernet Frame

- **Ethernet Header** + **ARP Payload**
- ARP is not carried in IP; it uses **Ethernet Type field = 0x0806**.

---

## ✅ Summary

- ARP packet contains **hardware and protocol addresses** of both sender and target.
- It helps devices map an IP address to a MAC address on a local network.
- Total ARP payload size: **28 bytes**, wrapped in an **Ethernet frame**.
