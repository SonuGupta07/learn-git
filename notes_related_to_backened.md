# Is a Server Hardware, Software, or Both?

A **server** can be:

## ‚úÖ Both Hardware and Software

---

## 1. Server as **Hardware**

This refers to a **physical machine** (a powerful computer) that stores data and runs services for other computers (clients).

- **Example**: A **rack-mounted server** in a data center.

---

## 2. Server as **Software**

This refers to a **program or application** that provides services to other programs or devices.

- **Example**:  
  - **Apache HTTP Server**  
  - **Node.js server**  
  - **MySQL server**

---

## üìå Summary

- **Hardware server**: The physical device.
- **Software server**: The program running on that device to serve requests.

> ‚úÖ Both usually work together ‚Äî server software runs on server hardware.
# ‚úÖ Definition of a Server

> A **server** is a computer system or software that provides services, resources, or data to other computers (called clients) over a network.

---

## üîπ Key Points

- A server can be **hardware**, **software**, or **both**.
- It **responds to client requests** and delivers services such as:
  - Web pages
  - Files
  - Databases
- Common types of servers:
  - **Web Server**
  - **Database Server**
  - **Mail Server**
  - **File Server**

---

## üìå Simple Example

When you open a website:

1. Your browser (client) sends a request to a **web server**.
2. The server processes the request and sends back the **web page**.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Visual Example


> ‚úÖ A server "serves" data, while a client "requests" it.
# üåê Is the IP of AWS Fixed or Dedicated?

## ‚úÖ Short Answer:
By default, **AWS IP addresses are not fixed** ‚Äî but you can assign a **dedicated (static) IP** using **Elastic IP**.

---

## üîπ Types of IP Addresses in AWS

### 1. **Public IP (Dynamic)**
- Assigned automatically when you launch an EC2 instance.
- **Changes** when you stop/start the instance.
- **Not suitable** for long-term fixed access.

### 2. **Elastic IP (Static)**
- A **dedicated IP address** that you can **reserve** and associate with your EC2 instance.
- **Stays the same** even if the instance is stopped and started again.
- Useful for:
  - Hosting websites
  - Long-term services
  - External APIs

---

## üìù Summary

| IP Type       | Fixed? | Charges | Use Case                |
|---------------|--------|---------|--------------------------|
| Public IP     | ‚ùå No  | Free    | Temporary access         |
| Elastic IP    | ‚úÖ Yes | Charged when not in use | Stable, long-term services |

> ‚úÖ Use **Elastic IP** if you need a **fixed/dedicated IP** in AWS.
# ‚úÖ Benefits of Dedicated (Elastic) IP in AWS ‚Äì Simple Explanation

## üîπ What is a Dedicated IP?
A **dedicated IP** in AWS (called an **Elastic IP**) is a **static IP address** that **doesn‚Äôt change**, even if you stop or restart your EC2 instance.

---

## üéØ Why Use a Dedicated IP?

### 1. **Stable Access**
- Your server always has the **same IP**.
- You don‚Äôt need to update DNS or settings every time.

### 2. **Hosting Websites**
- Needed when your domain (like `mywebsite.com`) points to your IP.
- Makes sure the site stays live even after a reboot.

### 3. **API or App Connection**
- If others connect to your server (e.g., via app or API), they can always reach it using the same IP.

### 4. **Remote Access**
- Easy to **SSH** or connect using tools that need a fixed IP.

---

## üìå Example

Without Elastic IP:
- IP = `54.32.10.88` (Today)
- After restart ‚Üí IP = `18.45.20.77` üòì

With Elastic IP:
- IP = `34.220.15.5` ‚úÖ (Always stays the same)

---

## üìù Summary

| Feature                | Without Elastic IP | With Elastic IP |
|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| IP changes on restart  | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚ùå No           |
| DNS stability          | ‚ùå Broken           | ‚úÖ Stable        |
| Good for hosting       | ‚ùå No               | ‚úÖ Yes           |
| Recommended for public access | ‚ùå No      | ‚úÖ Yes           |

> ‚úÖ Use **Elastic IP** if you want your AWS server to be **always reachable** with the same IP.
# üåê What is an HTTP Server?

## ‚úÖ Simple Definition:
An **HTTP server** is a **software or system** that listens for and responds to **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** requests from clients (usually web browsers).

---

## üîπ What It Does:
- Accepts requests from clients (like Chrome or Firefox).
- Processes the request (e.g., for a web page).
- Sends back a response (HTML, CSS, images, data, etc.).

---

## üß† How It Works (Basic Flow)

# üåê What is HTTP?

## ‚úÖ Simple Definition

**HTTP** stands for **HyperText Transfer Protocol**.  
It is the main protocol used on the web to **transfer data** between a client (like your browser) and a server.

---

## üîπ How HTTP Works

- When you type a website URL, your browser sends an **HTTP request** to the server.
- The server processes the request and sends back an **HTTP response** with the webpage or data.
- This communication happens using HTTP rules.

---

## üìå Key Features

- It is a **request-response protocol**.
- Works mainly over **port 80** (default for HTTP).
- Uses methods like:
  - `GET` ‚Äî request data (like a webpage)
  - `POST` ‚Äî send data (like form submission)
  - `PUT`, `DELETE`, and others for different actions

---

## üîë Why HTTP?

- It enables the **web to function**.
- Allows **browsers to talk to servers**.
- Supports **text, images, videos, files**, and more.

---

## üìù Summary

> HTTP is the language that web browsers and servers use to communicate and exchange web content.
# üîç Difference Between HTTP and HTTPS

| Feature             | HTTP                              | HTTPS                            |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Full Form**       | HyperText Transfer Protocol       | HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure |
| **Security**        | Not secure; data is sent in plain text | Secure; data is encrypted using SSL/TLS |
| **Port Number**     | 80                               | 443                             |
| **Data Encryption** | No encryption                    | Uses SSL/TLS encryption         |
| **Use Case**        | Websites without sensitive data  | Websites handling sensitive data (e.g., login, payments) |
| **Trust Indicator** | No padlock in browser address bar | Padlock icon shown in browser address bar |
| **Performance**     | Slightly faster (no encryption overhead) | Slightly slower due to encryption but usually negligible |
| **SEO Ranking**     | Lower priority                   | Higher priority by search engines like Google |

---

## üìå Summary

- **HTTPS** is the secure version of **HTTP**.
- It protects data during transfer by encrypting it.
- Always prefer **HTTPS** for security and trust.
# What is DNS?

**DNS** stands for **Domain Name System**. It is like the phonebook of the internet.

When you type a website address like `www.google.com` in your browser, your computer needs to find the exact location (IP address) of that website to connect to it. But IP addresses (like `142.250.190.14`) are hard to remember. DNS helps by translating the domain name into an IP address.

## How It Works

1. You enter a domain name in the browser (e.g., `example.com`).
2. The computer asks a **DNS server** to find the IP address.
3. The DNS server responds with the correct IP address.
4. The browser uses that IP address to connect to the website.

## Why DNS is Important

- It makes the internet easier to use.
- You don‚Äôt need to remember IP addresses.
- It connects human-friendly names to machine-friendly addresses.

## Example

Imagine DNS like a contact list on your phone:
- You search for "Mom" in your contacts (domain name).
- Your phone finds her phone number (IP address).
- Then it makes the call (connects to the server).

## Summary

- **DNS** = Domain Name System.
- It turns website names into IP addresses.
- It helps you reach websites easily and quickly.
# How Browser Handles the IP Address After Getting It from DNS

Once the browser receives the IP address of a website from the DNS server, it follows several steps to load the web page:

## 1. Establish a Connection
- The browser uses the IP address to **contact the web server**.
- It typically uses the **TCP protocol** to establish a connection through a process called the **TCP three-way handshake**.

## 2. Send an HTTP/HTTPS Request
- After the connection is established, the browser sends an **HTTP** or **HTTPS request** to the server.
- This request includes information such as:
  - The specific page being requested (e.g., `/index.html`)
  - The browser type (User-Agent)
  - Accepted content types

## 3. Web Server Responds
- The web server processes the request and sends back a **response**.
- This usually includes:
  - HTML content
  - CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.

## 4. Browser Renders the Page
- The browser starts **parsing** the HTML.
- It then:
  - Loads and applies CSS for styling
  - Executes JavaScript for dynamic behavior
  - Displays the final page to the user

## 5. Additional Resources
- If the page requires more files (like fonts, videos, or external scripts), the browser sends more requests to fetch them using the same or different IPs.

## Summary

- DNS gives the browser the IP address.
- The browser uses that IP to connect to the server.
- It requests the web page and other resources.
- Then, it displays the content to the user.
# How Port Number and Path Are Given in a URL

A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) can include different parts to tell the browser exactly where to go and what resource to access. Two important parts are the **port number** and the **path**.

---

## 1. Port Number in a URL

- The **port number** tells the browser which network port to use to connect to the server.
- It comes **after the domain name**, separated by a colon (`:`).

### Example with port number:
- Here, `8080` is the port number.
- If no port is specified, the browser uses the **default port** for the protocol (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).

---http://example.com:8080

## 2. Path in a URL

- The **path** specifies the exact resource or page on the server you want to access.
- It comes **after the domain name (and optional port number)**, starting with a slash (`/`).

### Example with path:
http://example.com/about/contact.html
- Here, `/about/contact.html` is the path to the specific page on the website.

---

## Full URL Example


- `example.com` = domain name
- `3000` = port number
- `/products/item1.html` = path to the resource

---

# Summary

- **Port number** in a URL is after the domain, separated by a colon (`:`).
- **Path** comes after the domain (and port) and starts with a slash (`/`).
- Both tell the browser where and how to connect to the correct resource on the server.
# What is an API?

**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**.

An API is a set of rules and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how requests and responses should be made so that programs can work together.

---

## Simple Explanation

Imagine an API like a waiter in a restaurant:

- You (the client) tell the waiter (API) what you want from the kitchen (server).
- The waiter takes your request, tells the kitchen, and then brings back your food (response).
- You don‚Äôt need to know how the kitchen prepares the food, just how to ask for it.

---

## Example of a Web API

A common example is a **weather API** that provides weather data.

### Request (example URL):

# üìò What is a Database?

A **Database** is a collection of organized data that is stored electronically. It helps in storing, managing, and retrieving data efficiently.

## ‚úÖ Simple Definition:
A **database** is like a digital **container** or **filing system** where data is stored in a structured format.

### üìå Example:
A **student database** may contain:
- Student names
- Roll numbers
- Marks
- Attendance

---

# üõ†Ô∏è What is DBMS?

**DBMS** stands for **Database Management System**. It is software that is used to create, manage, and operate a database.

## ‚úÖ Simple Definition:
A **DBMS** acts as a bridge between the user and the database. It helps in:
- Storing data
- Updating data
- Deleting data
- Retrieving data

### üìå Popular DBMS Examples:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
- MongoDB (for NoSQL)
- SQLite

---

## ‚úÖ Summary:
- **SQL** is a **language**.
- **PostgreSQL** is a **database** that uses SQL.

PostgreSQL = SQL + extra features like JSON, full-text search, indexing, extensions, etc.
# Summary: SQL vs MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle

- **MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle** are **DBMS** (Database Management Systems).  
  They are software that store, manage, and organize data.

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language) is a **language** used inside these DBMS to:  
  - Create databases and tables  
  - Insert, update, delete data  
  - Query and retrieve data  

---

### So:

| Term          | What it is                      | Role                           |

| Oracle        | DBMS software                 | Uses SQL to manage data        |

---

### Final note:  
SQL is the *language*, DBMS like MySQL and PostgreSQL are *software* that **use** SQL to manage data.

# Why SQL Syntax Differs Between Databases

- **SQL** is a standard language, but each **DBMS** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.) can have its own **dialect** or **version** of SQL.
- These differences happen because:
  - Each DBMS adds its own **features** or **extensions**.
  - Some commands or functions may work **slightly differently**.
  - Syntax for certain operations like string handling, date functions, or limits can vary.

---

## Example Differences:

| Operation         | MySQL Syntax                  | PostgreSQL Syntax            |
|-------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Limit results     | `SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 5;` | `SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 5;` (same here) |
| String concatenation | `CONCAT('Hello', ' ', 'World')` | `'Hello' || ' ' || 'World'` |
| Upsert (Insert or Update) | `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` | `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` |

---

## Summary:
- **Basic SQL commands are mostly the same** across databases.
- **Advanced features and some syntax differ** between DBMS.
- Always check the **specific DBMS documentation** when writing complex queries.

# 4 Types of NoSQL Databases

1. **Document Stores**  
   Store data as documents (e.g., JSON, BSON).  
   Example: MongoDB, CouchDB

2. **Key-Value Stores**  
   Store data as key-value pairs, very fast for simple lookups.  
   Example: Redis, DynamoDB

3. **Column-Family Stores**  
   Store data in columns rather than rows, optimized for large-scale distributed data.  
   Example: Apache Cassandra, HBase

4. **Graph Databases**  
   Store data as nodes and edges, ideal for relationships and network data.  
   Example: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune

# JSON vs BSON

| Feature           | JSON                              | BSON                                   |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Format**        | Text-based, human-readable       | Binary format, machine-efficient      |
| **Data Types**    | Limited (string, number, boolean, array, object, null) | Supports additional types like Date, Binary, int, long, floating point |
| **Size**          | Usually larger due to text format| Usually smaller due to binary encoding|
| **Parsing Speed** | Slower (text parsing)             | Faster (binary parsing)                |
| **Usage**         | Data interchange, APIs            | Internal storage and data transfer in MongoDB |
| **Readability**   | Easy to read and edit             | Not human-readable directly            |

---

### Summary
- **JSON** is great for data interchange and is easy for humans to read and write.
- **BSON** is optimized for storage and speed, used internally by MongoDB to handle complex data types efficiently.
# Why MongoDB Data is Readable Even Though Stored in Binary (BSON)

MongoDB stores data in **BSON** (Binary JSON) format internally, which is a binary format optimized for efficiency. However, when you interact with MongoDB, the data appears in a readable JSON-like format. Here‚Äôs why:

---

## How MongoDB Handles Data Storage and Retrieval

- **Storage:**  
  MongoDB stores data as **BSON**, which is compact and supports more data types than JSON. This binary format helps with fast storage and retrieval.

- **Retrieval:**  
  When you query data, MongoDB automatically **converts BSON back to JSON-like documents** that are easy to read and understand.

- **Drivers & Tools:**  
  MongoDB drivers (for languages like Node.js, Python, Java, etc.) handle this conversion, so the data you receive in your application looks like normal JSON or native objects.

- **Shell and GUIs:**  
  The MongoDB shell and GUI tools show documents in a **human-readable JSON format**, hiding the binary nature of BSON from users.

---

## Summary

| Aspect              | Explanation                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Internal storage    | BSON (binary, efficient)                    |
| Data sent to users  | JSON-like readable documents                |
| Conversion          | Automatic by MongoDB drivers and tools     |
| User experience     | Works like JSON, easy to read and manipulate |

---

MongoDB‚Äôs binary storage is **transparent** to the user, combining efficient storage with user-friendly data access.

---

If you want, I can explain more about BSON data types or how this conversion works under the hood!
# How MongoDB Converts BSON to JSON Under the Hood

1. **Data Storage in BSON**  
   MongoDB stores documents in BSON, a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. BSON includes extra data types (like dates, binary data) and is optimized for speed and size.

2. **Query or Fetch Request**  
   When you query MongoDB (using shell, drivers, or apps), the database fetches the BSON data from storage.

3. **BSON Deserialization**  
   The MongoDB server or driver **deserializes** the BSON binary data into an in-memory document object that represents the data structure (key-value pairs, arrays, nested objects).

4. **Type Mapping**  
   BSON types (like `Date`, `ObjectId`, `Binary`) are converted into their closest JSON equivalents or native language objects. For example:  
   - BSON `Date` ‚Üí JSON string or JavaScript `Date` object  
   - BSON `ObjectId` ‚Üí a string representation (hexadecimal)

5. **Serialization to JSON (for display or transfer)**  
   When data is returned to the client or shell, this in-memory object is **serialized** into a JSON-like string that is human-readable.

6. **In Drivers / Apps**  
   Drivers automatically handle this conversion, so your application code works with familiar JSON objects or native types without dealing with BSON directly.

---

### Summary Flow

# MongoDB Data Storage: BSON vs Document

- MongoDB **stores data internally as BSON** (Binary JSON), which is a compact, efficient binary representation of data.
- However, the data you work with in MongoDB is organized as **documents**, which are JSON-like structures (key-value pairs, nested objects).
- So, **documents are the logical data format**, and **BSON is the physical storage format**.

### In simple terms:
- You **write and read data as documents** (JSON-like).
- MongoDB **converts these documents into BSON** to store them efficiently on disk.
- When retrieving data, MongoDB **converts BSON back into documents** you can read and manipulate.

### Summary:

| Aspect            | Description                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Logical format    | Document (JSON-like objects)                    |
| Physical format   | BSON (binary, efficient storage format)        |
| User interaction | Works with documents (easy and flexible data)   |

---

This means both statements are correct:
- MongoDB **stores data as documents** (the way you think about and use the data).  
- MongoDB **actually stores data on disk in BSON format** (to be efficient).
# Document vs JSON

| Aspect          | Document                                  | JSON                                  |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Definition**  | A data structure used in databases like MongoDB; similar to JSON but stored internally as BSON | A lightweight data-interchange format, text-based and human-readable |
| **Format**     | JSON-like structure but stored as BSON internally in MongoDB | Text format with key-value pairs, arrays, nested objects |
| **Usage**      | Used to represent and store data in document databases (MongoDB) | Used for data exchange between systems and APIs |
| **Schema**     | Schema-less, allows different fields in each document | JSON itself does not enforce schema but is flexible |
| **Data Types** | Supports extended data types via BSON (dates, binary, ObjectId) | Supports basic types (string, number, boolean, array, object, null) |
| **Storage**    | Stored as BSON (binary JSON) for efficiency | Stored as plain text |

---

### Summary
- A **document** in MongoDB is a JSON-like object used for storing data, with richer data types and stored in BSON format.
- **JSON** is a plain text format used for representing and exchanging data.
# Is JSON Stored Internally in Binary Format?

### ‚ùå No, JSON is **not** stored in binary format by default.

## JSON

- **Format**: Text-based
- **Storage**: Stored as plain text (UTF-8 encoded)
- **Usage**: Used for APIs, configs, file storage (e.g., `.json` files)
- **Pros**: Human-readable, easy to edit
- **Cons**: Larger size, slower to parse

---

## BSON (Used in MongoDB Documents)

- **Format**: Binary JSON (BSON)
- **Storage**: Stored in binary format
- **Usage**: Internal storage in MongoDB
- **Pros**: Smaller size, faster parsing, supports more data types
- **Cons**: Not human-readable directly

---

### Key Difference

| Feature         | JSON (Text)             | BSON (Binary)            |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Human-readable   | ‚úÖ Yes                   | ‚ùå No                     |
| Stored as Text   | ‚úÖ Yes                   | ‚ùå No (Stored as binary)  |
| Supports Dates   | ‚ùå No (requires string)  | ‚úÖ Yes                    |
| Performance      | ‚ùå Slower to parse       | ‚úÖ Faster to parse        |

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

- JSON **remains text** in files and network transfer unless you explicitly convert it.
- BSON (used in MongoDB) **is binary**, designed for efficient storage and performance.
# UTF-8 vs Binary Format

UTF-8 and Binary format are related but different concepts. Here's a clear comparison:

---

## ‚úÖ What is UTF-8?

- **Type**: Character encoding
- **Purpose**: Converts human-readable text (like "A", "‰∏≠", "üòä") into binary (0s and 1s)
- **Output**: Binary (but structured to represent characters)
- **Used For**: Storing and transmitting text data

---

## ‚úÖ What is Binary Format?

- **Type**: General term for any data stored as 0s and 1s
- **Purpose**: Represents **any kind of data** (text, images, audio, numbers)
- **Output**: Raw binary data (not necessarily interpretable as text)
- **Used For**: Efficient storage of any type of data (files, media, machine instructions)

---

## üîç Key Differences

| Feature            | UTF-8                            | Binary Format                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**        | Encode text into binary          | Represent any kind of data as binary |
| **Scope**          | Only for textual data            | For all data types (text, image, video) |
| **Human-readable** | Yes (when decoded)               | No (unless specifically formatted)    |
| **Structure**      | Follows Unicode rules            | May have no structure (raw bytes)     |
| **Example Use**    | JSON files, HTML pages           | Images, executables, compressed files |

---

## üìå Summary

- **UTF-8** is a **specific binary encoding** for text.
- **Binary format** is a **general term** for how all digital data is stored and processed.
- So, **UTF-8 is a type of binary format**, but not all binary formats are UTF-8.

# üìÇ MongoDB Core Concepts: Collection, Document, Field

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses a flexible, schema-less data model. It has three main components:

---

## 1. üìÅ Collection

- A **collection** is a group of related documents.
- Similar to a table in relational databases.
- Documents in the same collection can have different structures.

### üî∏ Example:
```text
users
products
orders
````

---

## 2. üìÑ Document

* A **document** is a single record inside a collection.
* Stored internally as BSON, but viewed as JSON.
* Contains multiple key-value pairs called fields.

### üî∏ Example:

json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "alice@example.com"
}


---

## 3. üè∑Ô∏è Field

* A **field** is a key in a document.
* Each field has a value (string, number, array, object, etc.).
* Fields are like columns in SQL databases.

### üî∏ Example:

In the above document:

* `"name": "Alice"`
* `"age": 30`
* `"email": "alice@example.com"`

| Component  | Description                             | Example               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Collection | Group of related documents              | `users`, `orders`     |
| Document   | JSON-like object stored in a collection | `{ "name": "Alice" }` |
| Field      | Key-value pair inside a document        | `"name": "Alice"`     |

```

# üÜö SQL vs NoSQL

SQL and NoSQL are two main types of database systems. Here's a comparison between them:

---

## üìò SQL (Relational Databases)

- Structured Query Language (SQL) is used for managing relational databases.
- Data is stored in **tables (rows and columns)**.
- Follows a **fixed schema** (predefined structure).
- Examples: **MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server**

### üîπ Characteristics:
- Structured and organized data
- Uses JOINs to relate tables
- Strong ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- Vertical scaling (increase CPU/RAM of a single server)

---

## üìô NoSQL (Non-Relational Databases)

- NoSQL stands for **Not Only SQL**
- Data is stored in **flexible formats**: documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-columns
- **Schema-less**: fields can vary between records
- Examples: **MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Firebase**

### üî∏ Characteristics:
- Designed for unstructured/semi-structured data
- Scales horizontally (across many servers)
- Supports large volumes of fast-changing data
- BASE properties (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent)

---

## üßæ Comparison Table

| Feature           | SQL                            | NoSQL                          |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Data Model        | Tables (rows and columns)       | Documents, Key-Value, Graph, etc. |
| Schema            | Fixed (predefined)              | Dynamic (flexible)             |
| Query Language    | SQL                             | Varies (MongoDB uses JSON-like queries) |
| Joins             | Supports joins                  | Limited or not supported       |
| Scaling           | Vertical scaling                | Horizontal scaling             |
| Best For          | Structured, consistent data     | Large, distributed, unstructured data |
| Examples          | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle       | MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra      |

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Use **SQL** when data is structured and consistency is important.
- Use **NoSQL** when data is flexible, grows quickly, and needs to scale easily.
# üåê What is Distributed Computing?

**Distributed Computing** is a computing method where multiple computers (nodes) work together to perform a task. These systems **share resources** and **coordinate** over a network to process data and handle workloads efficiently.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Multiple Machines**: Tasks are split across several computers.
- **Parallel Processing**: Work is done at the same time on different nodes.
- **Scalability**: Easily handle more data by adding more nodes.
- **Fault Tolerance**: If one node fails, others can continue the work.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è How NoSQL Uses Distributed Computing

Most NoSQL databases (like MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.) are **designed for distributed computing**. Here‚Äôs how:

### üîπ 1. **Data Sharding**
- Data is **divided into parts** (shards) and stored on different servers.
- Improves speed and storage efficiency.

### üîπ 2. **Replication**
- Copies of data are stored on multiple servers.
- Ensures high availability and reliability.

### üîπ 3. **Horizontal Scaling**
- Add more machines to increase performance.
- No need to upgrade a single server.

---

## üîÅ NoSQL Example: MongoDB

- MongoDB uses **sharded clusters**.
- Each shard holds a portion of the data.
- Requests are distributed across nodes.
- If one server is down, others serve the data.

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits of Distributed Computing in NoSQL

| Benefit            | Description                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Speed              | Queries are processed in parallel            |
| Scalability        | Add more servers easily                      |
| High Availability  | System keeps working even if some parts fail |
| Big Data Handling  | Manage very large datasets efficiently       |

---

## üß† Summary

> **Distributed Computing** = Multiple machines working together  
> **NoSQL** databases use this to handle large-scale, fast, and flexible data storage.
